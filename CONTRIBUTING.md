# How to contribute
We ❤️ pull requests. If you'd like to fix a bug, contribute a feature or
just correct a typo, please feel free to do so, as long as you follow
our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Shopify/graphql-js-client/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
and the [Contributing Developer Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/Shopify/graphql-js-client/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_DEVELOPER_CERTIFICATE_OF_ORIGIN.txt).

If you're thinking of adding a big new feature, consider opening an
issue first to discuss it to ensure it aligns to the direction of the
project (and potentially save yourself some time!).

## Getting Started
To start working on the codebase, first fork the repo, then clone it:
```
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/graphql-js-client.git
```
*Note: replace "your-username" with your Github handle*

Install the project's dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Write some features.

Add some tests and make your change. Re-run the tests with:
```
npm run test
```

## Examples
See [here](https://github.com/Shopify/graphql-js-client/blob/master/examples) for our examples.

## Documentation
If your change affects how people use the project (i.e. adding or
changing arguments to a function, adding a new function, changing the
return value, etc), please ensure the documentation is also updated to
reflect this. Documentation is in the `README.md` if further documentation is needed please communicate via Github Issues.
